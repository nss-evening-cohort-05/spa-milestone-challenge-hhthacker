// The final IIFE should augment the object with two more functions. 
//One function resets the border thickness 
//and background color for each car element 
//back to the original values. 
//The other function changes the thickness 
//of the border of a car element, 
//and changes its background color. 
//The function must accept one argument.
    //A car DOM element that was clicked on.
